# attendance-percentage
## Real-life problems with specific requirements

Suppose, a class has 'N' number of students, and the teacher has taken 'M' number of classes till now. The teacher was taking attendance randomly in every class. Now the teacher wants to calculate and show the attendance percentage of each student and separately find out and print the list of the students who got below 75%.
</br>
**N.B:** Assume, the student's roll numbers are sequential. Students' roll numbers will always start from 1 and it will go up to N.
</br>
## Sample:
|       Instruction       |       Output       |
| ------------------| -------------------|
|N = 3, M = 3 </br>|Percentage:</br>|
|Day 1: [1, 2, 3] </br>Day 2: [1, 3]</br>Day 3: [3] | Student 1: 66.66% </br>Student 2: 33.33%</br> Student 3: 100%|

#### Instruction
Values of N and M is by default coded = 3. Change the value if you want to</br>
If student present the day **type 1 else 0**.
